<h1>lager</h1>
Lagers, from the German word “lagern” meaning to store, are made with a bottom or cold-fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces Uvarum  – see sidebar) that sinks to the bottom of the brew during the fermentation process.   While ales can be brewed in as little as 7 days, lagers Amazon Imagetraditionally need to age before their brewing process is complete.  This can increase their brewing time to more than a month or more.<br><br>
  This longer, colder fermentation process inhibits the production of esters (which give beer a more fruity taste) and avoids other fermentation byproducts common in ales. The lager process creates beers with a generally cleaner, smoother, crisper, and more mellow taste.  Unlike ales, lagers should always be served cold.  The lager is also the most popular style of beer in the world, with some stating that it accounts for 90% of all beers consumed (a large portion of this is from the mass produced watered down lagers of the major US breweries).
